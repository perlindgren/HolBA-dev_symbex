This directory contains formalisations and SML code to lift machine
code instructions and programs to BIR programs. The main entry point
is "bir_inst_liftingLib". It provides top-level functions for
performing such liftings. Please look at its signature for details.

A large component of the lifter is the expression lifter, which is
able to construct bir-expressions corresponding to terms of word types.
