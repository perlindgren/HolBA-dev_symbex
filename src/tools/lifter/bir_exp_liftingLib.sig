   (* Expression Lifting functions *)
   (********************************)

   (* The lifter works by backchaining using theorems of the form

      [some assumptions] |- bir_is_lifted_exp env e v

      We need to somehow find such theorems to apply. This is done
      via exp_lifting_fun - records. Their job is given terms "env" and "v"
      produce a theorem like above. Usually the variables in expression e
      should be freshly generated and constrained via the assumptions.

      If no such theorem can be created, a HOL_ERR exception should be raised.
      This core functionality is available via elf_apply.
   *)

   val elf_apply : exp_lifting_fun_rec -> term -> term -> thm


   (* Later, we need to select efficiently between many lifting functions to
      check, which to try first. To implement this, there is guard term
      available. If this guard does not match a term "v", then
      "elf_apply r env v" should fail. Using this guard, many lifting functions
      can be quickly discarded without actually calling them.

      To construct a exp_lifting_fun_rec one needs to provide the actual
      function creating theorems as well as an optional guard term. If no guard is
      given, the lifting function will always be tried (WARNING: inefficient). *)
   val mk_elf : term option (* Guard *) -> (term -> term -> thm) (* apply_fun *) -> exp_lifting_fun_rec

   (* To further select between many possible lifting functions, they contain a
      precedence. The precedence is an integer. Functions with lower precedence are
      tried first. There are a few predefined precedences, by default the precedence
      elf_precedence_default is used. *)

   val elf_set_precedence : exp_lifting_fun_rec -> int -> exp_lifting_fun_rec


   (* Sometimes it is handy to make the apply function fail more frequently.
      "elf_add_check cf" adds a check. If for terms "env" and "v" "cf env v" either
      returns "false" or raises a HOL_ERR, then also elf_apply is made to raise a HOL_ERR. *)

   (* Given a list of theorems, "elfs_of_thms" preprocesses these theorems and creates
      expression lifting functions. Usually all variables in these theorems can be
      freely instantiated by the expression lifter. A list of variables that should not be
      instantiated, they can be passed as an extra argument.

      For debugging purposes, also the preprocessing function
      is exported. *)

   (* This is the main workhorse. Given an environment term env_t,
      a lifting net eln and a value to lift v

      bir_exp_lift env_t eln v

      tries to produce a theorem with conclusion

      "bir_is_lifted_imm_exp env ... v".

      The value v actually processed via gen_mk_BLV allowing some freedom. *)
   val bir_exp_lift : term -> exp_lifting_net -> term -> thm

   (* often one does not care about the environment. Therefore, it is convenient to
      just use a suitable named var. *)
   val bir_var_environment_t_default : term
   val bir_exp_lift_default_env : exp_lifting_net -> term -> thm


   (* Internally bir_exp_lift is implemented using several steps.

      First an initial theorem is created via "bir_exp_lift env v".
      Next this theorem is processed via

      "bir_exp_lift_continue eln (cache, thm)"

      The cache is a special datastructure of used to
      avoid lifting multiple subexpressions several times.
      One starts with an empty on which is augmented.
      bir_exp_lift_continue can be called multiple times
      always using the results of the previous call.

      Finally the cache is thrown away and the theorem processed via
      bir_exp_lift_final.

      These functions are exported, since they might be helpful to
      write specialized lifters. *)
