TODO:
some approach to "collapse" components?
- cutting/instantiation experiment, based on inspected CFG
- if this works and has positive effect, automatically find cutting points by trying each branch and see if it is possible to find common merge point?

no point to do this with fadd:
- run without function instantiation for comparison (write down numbers to see effects of optimizations)
- expected runtime 4h, but no difference in exectime due to constant execution time of subfunction


*)

results:
(consider cut before the function call, which involves feasibility check, for state counting)

key - a states in total,
    - b are not assert failed/still running/reached the end,
    - c are feasible,
    - x - min_countw,
    - y - max_countw.

- plain running: about 25min,
    a=21000::48000, b=1129::2781, c=129::297, x=58, y=161.
- plain running with ite-countw: about 7min,
    a=11417:: 8709, b= 613:: 585, c=129::203, x=58, y=161.


(* why are these numbers so different?
- ite assignment branching and merging at cjmp complicates this kind of validation
- now hypoLib is fixed to underestimate the branching - does not account for lsls instructions for example that assign ite exp, which is not used for countw and not used for cjmp, not what we actually want
- restricting ite branching to assignments to countw cuts the final states and execution time in half. more dramatic for whole fadd (from 25min to 7min) minmax stays the same.

time for fun2 until call (collect travinfo, drive symbexec):
187s, 395s (210s after ite-countw)

count nodes on all paths (fun1, fun2 until call):
61
9705 (here we probably visit more nodes)

number of paths (fun1, fun2 until call):
8
580 (actually it's 1129, 613 after after restricting ite branching to countw)

number of paths including assert (fun1, fun2 until call)
69
10857 (actually it's 20937, 11417 after restricting ite branching to countw)
