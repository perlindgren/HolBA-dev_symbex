(* An enumeration is represented by a pair of a reference to the current value
and a 'step' function that returns the next value. This step function usually
contains in its closure the real state of the enumeration, whereas the current
value can be interpreted as a cache.

Invariants:
- Enumerations are infinite sequences, usually cyclic
- The step function always terminates
