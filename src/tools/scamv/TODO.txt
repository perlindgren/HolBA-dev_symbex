Scam-V TODOs

* Testing: Add more test-* files to exercise the api of each of the modules

* DB / query language

* Code cleanup in scamv_driver: there is still a bit of dead code

* Scam-V state: The 'global state' of Scam-V should probably be abstracted into
  a separate module and made easily available to other modules. More precisely,
  this would include all the global refs in scamv_driverLib with names of the
  form current_* such as

  current_pathstruct, current_prog_id, current_prog, etc. 

  Abstracting these away should help clean up interfaces of bir_trainingLib and
  perhaps bir_rel_synthLib. The entry point and options handling could also be
  moved away from scamv_driverLib.

* Support for observations with list of arbitrary length

* Change observational model to encode in the observation list also the type of
  observation (e.g. pc vs. load)

- Comment: Do we need the observation channel, or can we encode this in the
  observation list (see last TODO above)?
